**Angry Match** it is a Memory game where you can choose the theme of your cards. Our mascot gets easily annoyed, so pay close attention.

## Tools

- JavaScript
- React.js
- CSS (Styled Components)

## Goals

The main objective of this project was to use React and Styled Components. I used the Unsplash API to fetch the photos.

The game works well on mobile devices, where a smaller number of cards are generated to fit the screen. There is a limit of attempts, and in case of defeat, the player plays the same game with shuffled cards. In case of victory, they return to the initial screen. All the artwork was created using Midjourney.
